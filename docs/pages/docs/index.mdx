## Overview

"Plaiceholder" is a suite of **server-side** functions for creating low quality image placeholders (LQIP).

There is no "one-size-fits-all" LQIP strategy, so we offer them all…

- [**Color**](/docs/usage#color)  
  It's just a color
- [**CSS**](/docs/usage#css)  
  ~600B when rendered as CSS
- [**SVG**](/docs/usage#svg)  
  ~1.2kB when rendered in HTML
- [**Base64**](/docs/usage#base64)  
  ~300B asset size

Give each strategy a try to see what works best for your individual use-case.

### Tradeoffs

Whilst most strategies offer fast `DOMContentLoaded` and `LCP`, it's important to consider the caveats of each:

- [**Color**](/docs/usage#color)  
  Plain; not the most exciting.
- [**CSS**](/docs/usage#css)  
  Won't maintain ratio for images that use `object-fit`
- [**SVG**](/docs/usage#svg)  
  Doesn't (yet) leverage [SVG filter primitives](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/SVG/Element/feGaussianBlur)
- [**Base64**](/docs/usage#base64)  
  Not the nicest looking. Even though plaiceholder makes an opinionated choice to slightly increase saturation for base64 images under-the-hood, colors can often appear drab
