<Callout type="info">

Plaiceholder is a server-side library. It will **not** work in the browser.

`plaiceholder` works on all runtimes supported by [`sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/).

[`sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) is currently limited to Node.js, but there is a [pull request](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/pull/3522) to expand support.

## Prerequisites

Under-the-hood, Plaiceholder uses the wonderful and powerful [`sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) library to transform images.

Some frameworks or libraries include `sharp` by default, so double-check before you install.

```sh
npm install sharp
```

## Installation

```sh
npm install plaiceholder
```
